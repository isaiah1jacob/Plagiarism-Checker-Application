# Plagiarism-Checker-Application
A plagiarism checker application! That's a great idea

Here's a high-level overview of how we can approach this project:

Components:

Text Input: A user interface to input the text to be checked for plagiarism.
Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the input text to remove stop words, punctuation, and convert to a standardized format.
Database of Sources: A database of existing texts, articles, and sources to compare the input text against.
Similarity Algorithm: An algorithm to measure the similarity between the input text and the sources in the database.
Plagiarism Detection: A module to analyze the similarity scores and determine if the input text contains plagiarized content.
Reporting: A user interface to display the plagiarism report, including the percentage of plagiarized content and the sources of the plagiarized text
